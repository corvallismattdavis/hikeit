<em>This will be a stand alone android application, we are starting from scratch and building it forwards to become a complete android application. Researching topics include: how to create and develop android applications, the linkage of a backend to a front end for data access, proper version control, and analysis of how other people have tried to solve this problem. For any application creativity is key to keep the user interested and engaged with design in mind to keep things easily accessible.</em>.
